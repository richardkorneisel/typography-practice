    <h1>Seahorses</h1>

    <img src="images/horse.jpg" alt="seahorse">

    <p>Don’t let my unusual shape fool you—I’m actually a fish! We’re most closely related to pipefishes and seadragons
        (I bet you can see the resemblance in our long noses). Unlike most other fish, we swim upright. We are generally
        pretty small, and range from about the size of a thumbnail to more than a foot long. The genus Hippocampus
        includes 47 species of seahorses, and almost 1/3 of those were discovered within the last decade—there are
        probably more that haven’t been discovered!</p>
    <p>It can be difficult to spot us in the wild. In addition to our generally small size, we are experts in
        camouflage, and many of us have similar patterns to our habitat, allowing us to seamlessly blend into coral or
        seagrass. This helps us both hide from predators and sneak up on prey. Unfortunately, we can’t always hide, and
        one of the largest threats to our population is illegal capture by humans for use in traditional medicines and
        home.</p>

    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
